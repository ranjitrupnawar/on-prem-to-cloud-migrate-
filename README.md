Decide on a multi-cloud or hybrid approach if necessary.
Plan data migration with minimal downtime.

3. Application Optimization
Use autoscaling for traffic management.
Implement containerization (Docker) for portability.
Use serverless computing for event-driven applications.

4. Performance Optimization
Optimize images with CDNs for faster load times.
Minimize CSS, JS, and enable lazy loading.

Set up monitoring (e.g., CloudWatch, Grafana).
Use logging tools for tracking performance and issues.
Establish automated backups and disaster recovery plans.
